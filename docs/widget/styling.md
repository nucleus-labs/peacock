# Peacock Widgets

Peacock maps from document nodes to iced widgets. A part of this process is providing faculties for applying
style data to the document nodes prior to widget conversion.<br/>The style that gets applied, and what it gets
applied to, is defined using CSS. As such, it is necessary to document how css properties affect the elements.
