### What is a Widget?

A **widget** is a basic building block used to create user interfaces (UIs). Think of it like a LEGO piece in a
LEGO set: each widget has a specific role, and you can combine them in different ways to build something
functional and visually appealing.

In the context of Peacock, widgets are the elements you interact with or see on a screen when using a
software application. For example:
- A **button** you click to submit a form is a widget.
- A **text box** where you type your name is a widget.
- A **label** that displays information, like the current date, is also a widget.

### How Widgets Work

Widgets are like mini-tools that come with their own set of instructions on how they should look and behave.
They are designed to:

1. **Display Information**: Widgets can show text, images, or shapes.
2. **Take Input**: Some widgets let users interact with them, like clicking a button or typing in a text field.
3. **React to Actions**: Widgets can change or perform tasks when something happens, such as changing color
when hovered over with a mouse.

### Why Widgets Matter

Widgets make it easier to build applications by breaking the UI into manageable pieces. Instead of
creating everything from scratch, you can use pre-built widgets and focus on how they work together. It's
like assembling furniture with pre-cut pieces instead of carving the wood yourself.

### Widgets in Peacock

In Peacock, widgets are defined using **XML** (a language for describing UI structure) and **CSS**
(used to style the appearance). You write instructions for how your widgets should look and behave, and
Peacock takes care of turning those instructions into something users can see and interact with.

For example:
- You might use a **button** widget in XML, give it a label like "Click Me", and style it with CSS to
make it blue.
- Peacock uses this definition to create the actual button on the screen.

### Summary

Widgets are the building blocks of user interfaces. They simplify creating applications by providing reusable
pieces that handle specific tasks. In Peacock, widgets let designers focus on visuals and functionality
without needing to dive into complex programming.
